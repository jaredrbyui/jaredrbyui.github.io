            <h1>Weather Site Plan</h1>
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of <em><b>The Weather Site</b></em> is to give current weather conditions in 3 <br>
                        different ways. The initial page will give the weather for the current location <br>
                        based on the Geocoding location information from the device. The second is <br>
                        weather for 3 specific locations accessible through a dedicated link, and the <br>
                        third is weather for any location determined by a search string</p>
                <h2>Audience</h2>
                    <p>Primary audience is adults ages 18-30. Most will be students. Access to the <br>
                        site will be split between mobile devices and laptops. A secondary audience <br>
                        will be anyone interested in weather.</p>
                    <h3> Audience Goals:</h3>
                        <p>College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get <br>
                            the weather conditions for their current location as they head off to class or <br>
                            study. They are also often far from their homes so the ability to quickly get the <br>
                            conditions for a specific location is important as well. The third goal deals <br>
                            with planning for travels... the ability to get weather conditions for any <br>
                            location will help with last minute packing for road trips.</p>
                    <h3>Persona</h3>
                        <img src="images/cool-joe.jpg" alt="cool joe">
                        <p><b>Name</b>: Cool Joe</p>
                        <p><b>Occupation</b>: Student</p>
                        <p><b>Age</b>: Eternally 18</p>
                        <p><b>Interests</b>: Traveling, Flying, Play Acting, Eating</p>
                        <p><b>Motivation</b>: Joe is not into planning. His last minute scrambling, whether it is getting to class <br>
                            in the morning or heading out on his latest adventure, has left him unprepared for weather <br>
                            conditions many times (He is tired of sleeping in the rain and snow). Hewould like to be more <br>
                            prepared... without having to put much efforit into it... or planning.</p>
                        <p><b>Environment</b>: Joe is comfortable using laptops and mobile devices, he will most often <br>
                        be found on a smart phone however. Many of the places he frequents do not have great signal... he <br>
                        is often dealing with 3G speeds.</p>
                <h2>Content</h2>
                    <p>All weather pages should include location name, current temperature, forecast <br>
                    high, forecast low, current weather descriptor, forecast percentage of <br>
                    precipitation, and current wind speed and direction on small devices and <br>
                    hourly temps should be added on larger screens. The pages of the <i><b>Weather</b></i> <br>
                    <i><b>Site</b></i> will be built in the following order:</p>
                    <h3>Pages<h3>
                        <p>1. <b>Franklin and Greenville</b> weather for each specific location. The weather for these pages <br>
                        should be pulled from the weather.JSON file that will be provided.</p>
                        <p>2. <b>Current</b>: weather for the current location. Current location should be determined by using <br>
                        the Geolocation API of the browser. This information should be passed to the National <br>
                        Weather Service (NWS) API to retrieve the current conditions.</p>
                        <p>3. <b>Search</b>: Begins with only a search box, characters entered will cause a list of suggested <br>
                        matches to appear. Selected location will pull up the weather.</p>
